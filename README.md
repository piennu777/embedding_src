## What is?
- It is a tool that embeds a link in plain sight.
- Compared to others, a four-digit deletion key is generated at the same time as the URL is generated, which can also be used to delete the URL.
- You can decide the name of the directory yourself.
- Free API is also provided. (Currently not possible)
